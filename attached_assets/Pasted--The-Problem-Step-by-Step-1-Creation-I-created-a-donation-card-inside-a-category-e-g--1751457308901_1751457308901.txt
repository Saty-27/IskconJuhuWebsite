🧩 The Problem (Step-by-Step):
🐞 1. Creation:

I created a donation card inside a category (e.g., "Shiv Daan") from the Admin Panel.
After clicking "Create", the card is saved in the database.
However, it does NOT display in the frontend (under the correct donation category) immediately.
When I check the database or refresh the admin panel, the card is there, but not rendering in frontend.
✅ 2. Manual Fix (Temporary):

If I manually click "Edit" on that donation card in the Admin Panel,
Then enter the details again (payment details, amount, image),
And click “Update” → only then does it show up properly in the frontend.
❌ Problem Summary:

The data from initial creation is not fully saved or not fetched/rendered correctly.
It requires an update manually to reflect properly.
This is inefficient. I want it to work immediately after creation.
🔁 Problem in Payment Details:
Each donation card (like "Shiv Daan") has its own unique payment details (QR image, account, UPI).
But on the frontend, all donation cards are showing the same global/common payment detail.
Even if I add unique payment info per card in the admin → frontend still shows only the first or default payment data.
🧪 Admin Panel Modal Edit Bug:
When I click "Edit" on a donation card in admin panel, the modal opens.
But it does not auto-fill the current data (title, amount, image, payment info).
I have to re-enter all data manually again to update.
Expected behavior: When I open edit modal → it should fetch and show existing data for that donation card.
✅ What I Need to Fix:
On Create Donation Card, it should:
Save all fields correctly (including payment info).
Immediately show in frontend under the selected category.
Each donation card should:
Have its own payment details shown in frontend (not common/global).
Load these payment details correctly when fetched.
Admin Panel "Edit" modal should:
Automatically fetch existing data for the clicked card.
Show it in the form fields for editing without re-entering everything.
