üßæ Issue Summary: Donation Card & Payment Details Bug ‚Äì Janmashtami Section
1. Donation Card Not Displaying for Janmashtami

You‚Äôve created specific donation cards under the Janmashtami category, but they‚Äôre not appearing on the frontend.
Possible causes:
Cards may not be correctly linked to the Janmashtami category ID in the database.
The frontend fetch query might not be filtering cards by category properly.
2. Same Payment Details Showing for All Cards

You uploaded different payment details (image, bank info, UPI, QR code) for each donation card.
However, on the client-side, all donation cards are showing the same payment details, regardless of the card selected.
Likely issue:
The frontend might be using static or shared state/payment object for all cards.
Backend API might not be returning card-specific payment detail fields correctly.
3. Admin Panel: Details Not Fetching on Card Click

When you click on a donation card in the Admin Panel, it should show the current data (title, image, amount, description, and specific payment details).
Instead, either no data is fetched, or outdated/default data is shown.
Likely reasons:
Card ID not passed correctly in the click function.
Edit modal may not be linked to dynamic data fetching.
Backend endpoint might not be returning card-specific data, or frontend state is not updating on modal open.
‚úÖ What Needs to Be Fixed
Ensure Cards Are Fetched by Janmashtami Category ID
Check MongoDB or backend logic: Make sure each card is linked to the correct category.
Verify that your frontend API call filters by the correct category _id.
Fix Dynamic Payment Detail Rendering
Ensure payment details are stored per card in the database (not globally).
Update the frontend logic to display the payment details of the specific card being viewed or clicked.
Confirm backend API is returning the correct paymentDetails object per card.
Fix Admin Panel Modal Data Binding
Ensure the ‚ÄúEdit/View‚Äù modal pulls the correct card data using the card‚Äôs unique ID.
On click of a card:
Trigger an API call to get the current details of that card.
Bind those details into the modal fields.
Confirm that form values are dynamic and reset on every card click.
